arch-tetra SLiM Login Manager theme
=============================

Introduction
------------
This package contains minimal login theme for the SLiM login manager 
(http://slim.berlios.de/).

Requirements
------------
For proper viewing, this theme relies on the 'egdes' typeface (font),
from Artwiz (http://artwizaleczapka.sourceforge.net/).  These fonts 
may already be available from your distribution's repository.  

Arch Linux users can install them by running the following as root:

    # pacman -S artwiz-fonts

Installation
------------
Installation will depend upon your distribution; typically SLiM themes
are placed in '/usr/share/slim/themes/'

Arch Linux users can install it with their preferred method via AUR:
    https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/slim-theme-arch-tetra/

Once installed, activate a given theme by editing the SLiM config,
located at '/etc/slim.conf' for Arch Linux users. Change the value for 
'current_theme' to the name of the theme folder:

    current_theme   arch-tetra
